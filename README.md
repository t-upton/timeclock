# timeclock
Simple time clock for employees to clock-in and clock-out.

I searched around for a simple solution to keep track of employees clocking-in and clocking-out. Many projects I found cost money and/or force features not needed.

With keeping this simple, it will allow me to interchange different parts for different solutions.
  Example, visually validating the correct user typed in their PIN instead of someone else doing them a favor. I can use some 3rd party software that will take a picture everytime movement is detected, and for this, there is plenty of software available.
  Another example, syncing the timestamps so data is not lost or abused. I'll need to find a solution that has version control and regularly updates in case someone tries to alter the timestamps.

I figure the computer will only have a $10 usb number pad connected to it. It'll have a webcam that takes picture on motion control. Time sync will be very important. Computer will need to be located near field of view of webcam so if anyone tries to screw with the computer, they'll have a picture taken. Also possibly watch the logs in case anyone attaches any usb device. 

Then also need to remember KISS. Keep this solution as simple as possible. For flexibility and ease of deployment for other users.
